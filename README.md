# Blink API Postman collection 

The Postman collection is up-to-date with all of the Blink API's most current features and is an excellent way to understand how the API can work in your system.

## Get started 

Download the repo and import the environment and collection file into postman. In the environment, you change the *api_key* and *secret_key* to your own keys or you can use the default ones which are demo keys. Using live keys through Postman is not recommended.
